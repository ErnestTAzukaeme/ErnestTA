# Hazard Analysis: U.S. Pipeline Hazmat Incidents (2010–2018)

## Purpose
Analyze and predict hazardous material pipeline incidents in the U.S. from 2010 to 2018. The project identifies patterns and provides insights to enhance safety planning and hazard mitigation efforts.

## Background
Leveraging 4 years of experience as a National Guard Hazmat Specialist,  I combined my  practical hazmat expertise with data science skills developed through Jose Portilla’s [*Python for Machine Learning and Data Science*](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) course.

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned data and engineered features using Pandas ([PHMSA Incidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/webmadster/phmsa-incidents-since-2010)).
- **Exploratory Analysis & Visualization:** Created interactive visualizations using Plotly Dash to highlight incident trends and geographic patterns.
- **Modeling & Prediction:** Built and optimized Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, interpreting results with SHAP values.
- **Clustering & Anomaly Detection:** Identified incident patterns and anomalies with KMeans clustering and Isolation Forest.

## Project Highlights
- **Enhanced Data Quality:** Cleaned over **1,200+ records** using Pandas, significantly improving dataset reliability.
- **Improved Model Recall:** Increased predictive recall by approximately **90%** using a tuned XGBoost classifier.
- **Anomaly Identification:** Detected and analyzed **33 anomalous incidents** via Isolation Forest for targeted hazard prevention.
