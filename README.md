# Ernest Tejiri Azukaeme - AI & Machine Learning Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Ernest! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Statistics at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management while expanding my skills in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science through online courses and hands‑on projects.

I am passionate about applying AI and machine learning to solve real‑world problems in business, finance, and sports analytics. I am actively completing courses in machine learning, Python, SQL, and R, and applying these skills in independent projects that showcase predictive modeling, data visualization, and AI applications.

In my free time, I enjoy combining my interest in sports and data by building NBA analytics tools, while also working on finance‑related projects such as fraud detection and credit risk modeling. I am committed to continuous learning and excited to contribute to the growing field of AI and data science.

My CV in [pdf](link-to-your-cv.pdf).

This repository is created to showcase my skills, share projects, and track my progress in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science projects, briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### AI NBA MVP Predictor
**Goal:** Predict the NBA Most Valuable Player using machine learning and simulation.

**Code:** [`AI NBA MVP Predictor.ipynb`](link-to-your-notebook)

**Description:** This project uses NBA player statistics from APIs to train machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and run Monte Carlo simulations to estimate MVP probabilities. It includes data collection, feature engineering, model tuning, and visualization with an interactive dashboard.

**Skills:** API integration, machine learning, simulation, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Scikit‑Learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.  
**Results:** Generated probabilistic predictions for MVP candidates; visualized top contenders with confidence intervals.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Goal:** Build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Code:** [`Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb`](link-to-your-notebook)

**Description:** Trained and evaluated classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) on a real‑world credit card transactions dataset. Used techniques like undersampling, oversampling, and SMOTE to handle class imbalance. Evaluated performance using precision, recall, F1‑score, and ROC/AUC.

**Skills:** machine learning, imbalanced data handling, model evaluation.  
**Technology:** Python, Scikit‑Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.  
**Results:** Achieved 93% precision on fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

### Customer Churn Prediction
**Goal:** Predict customer churn for a telecommunications company.

**Code:** [`Customer Churn Prediction.ipynb`](link-to-your-notebook)

**Description:** Built a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using customer demographics, service usage, and account information. Performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest), and hyperparameter tuning.

**Skills:** predictive modeling, feature engineering, model tuning.  
**Technology:** Python, Scikit‑Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.  
**Results:** Identified key drivers of churn and achieved an accuracy of 85% on test data.

### SQL for Financial Data Analysis
**Goal:** Analyze financial transactions and account data using SQL queries.

**Code:** [`SQL Financial Analysis Queries.sql`](link-to-your-sql-file)

**Description:** Wrote SQL queries to clean and analyze transactional data from a retail bank. Generated reports for total spending, average account balances, transaction patterns, and customer segmentation. Used joins, window functions, CTEs, and subqueries to answer business questions.

**Skills:** SQL querying, data cleaning, reporting.  
**Technology:** PostgreSQL / SQL Server.

---

### 8-Week SQL Challenge
**Goal:** Complete the [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) solving business SQL case studies.

**Code:** [`8-Week SQL Challenge Solutions`](link-to-your-sql-files)

**Description:** Solved SQL problems including data wrangling, analytics queries, window functions, joins, subqueries, and reporting tasks across multiple industries.

**Skills:** SQL query optimization, analytical querying.  
**Technology:** PostgreSQL.

---

### Loan Default Prediction
**Goal:** Predict loan default risk using machine learning models in R.

**Code:** [`Loan Default Prediction.R`](link-to-your-R-script)

**Description:** Trained logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models on loan application data. Performed EDA, data cleaning, feature selection, cross‑validation, and ROC/AUC evaluation.

**Skills:** machine learning in R, model evaluation, data visualization.  
**Technology:** R, caret, ggplot2, tidyverse.  
**Results:** Achieved 88% accuracy and identified top features influencing loan defaults.
