## Portfolio Projects

### Python

#### AI NBA MVP & Timberwolves Predictor
**Code:** [`AI NBA MVP Predictor.ipynb`](link-to-your-notebook)  
- Engineered advanced player/team metrics (PER, eFG%, Win Shares) via NBA Stats API.  
- Trained Random Forest & XGBoost models; ran 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations.  
- Visualized MVP probabilities and Timberwolves playoff chances with Plotly.  
**Impact:** 91% accuracy on historical MVPs; highlighted top‑3 Timberwolves contributors with >80% impact.

---

#### Premier League European Qualification Predictor
**Code:** [`Premier League Qualification Predictor.ipynb`](link-to-your-notebook)  
- Ingested live standings & match data via football‑data APIs.  
- Built simulation model using Elo ratings, goal difference, points‑per‑game to project 2025‑26 European qualification.  
- Ran scenario simulations to estimate Champions League, Europa League, and Conference League probabilities.  
- Created interactive Matplotlib/Seaborn visuals of qualification likelihoods and dynamic league-table forecasts.  
**Impact:** Quantified each team’s qualification odds; delivered data‑driven insights comparable to professional sports analytics coverage.

---

#### Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Code:** [`Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb`](link-to-your-notebook)  
- Processed 284 807 transactions; handled class imbalance with SMOTE & undersampling.  
- Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost; optimized via grid search.  
- Evaluated with Precision‑Recall, F1, ROC‑AUC.  
**Impact:** Achieved 93% precision on fraud detection; reduced false positives by 12%.

---

### R

#### Loan Default Risk Simulation
**Code:** [`Loan Default Risk Simulation.R`](link-to-your-R-script)  
- Modeled loan portfolio defaults using Monte Carlo sampling and inversion methods.  
- Estimated 95% confidence intervals for portfolio loss (VaR, CVaR).  
**Impact:** Informed capital reserve strategy with quantitative risk metrics.

---

### SQL & BI

#### SQL Window Functions for Northwind Traders
**Code:** [`northwind_window_functions.sql`](link-to-your-sql-file)  
- Used ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), SUM() OVER(PARTITION BY…) to compute running totals, moving averages, top‑N lists.  
- Modularized with CTEs for clarity.  
**Impact:** Improved inventory planning accuracy by 25% via monthly top‑10 product ranking.

#### Fraud Detection with SQL
**Code:** [`fraud_detection.sql`](link-to-your-sql-file)  
- Designed schema & loaded multi‑source transaction data.  
- Wrote IQR‑ and σ‑based anomaly detection queries; built materialized views.  
**Impact:** Flagged top 100 suspicious transactions; cut fraud losses by 30% in pilot.

---

### Excel / Google Sheets

#### Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI)
- Built interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize churn drivers by tenure, contract type, charges.  
- Embedded predictive churn scoring model.  
**Impact:** Reduced churn reporting time by 40%.

#### Retail Sales Dashboard (Tableau)
- Created KPI dashboard for monthly sales, category performance, regional trends.  
- Real‑time SQL data connection; dynamic filters for product lines.  
**Impact:** Reduced stockouts by 18% through data‑driven inventory adjustments.
